# Applied-Regression-Analysis
Basic R programs implementing statistical concepts from regression analysis

project1: Evaluating the linearity of 1999 data on sale prices and total appraised values in Tampa Florida neighborhoods. Topics include making a scatterplot, computing the pearson correlation coefficient, making a linear regression model, obtaining the anova table, obtaining the fitted y hat values, and plotting confidence bands.

project2: Considering 1987 baseball salary data, the 'best' model will be found and the R^2 will be computed. The model assumptions, such as normality, homoscedasticity, independence and linearity will be checked. In addition to outlier detection and multicollinearity. The prediction interval for a new player is determined.
