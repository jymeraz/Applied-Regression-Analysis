# Applied-Regression-Analysis
Basic R programs implementing statistical concepts from regression analysis

project1: Evaluating the linearity of 1999 data on sale prices and total appraised values in Tampa Florida neighborhoods. Topics include making a scatterplot, computing the pearson correlation coefficient, making a linear regression model, obtaining the anova table, obtaining the fitted y hat values, and plotting confidence bands.

project2: Considering 1987 baseball salary data, the 'best' model will be found and the R^2 will be computed. The model assumptions, such as normality, homoscedasticity, independence and linearity will be checked. In addition to outlier detection and multicollinearity. The prediction interval for a new player is determined.

project3: Using Fisher's iris data set, multiple linear analysis is performed. Exploratory data analysis on the length across each species is examined through boxplots. A one-way anova is used to compare the mean length across the species ignoring the width. An analysis of covariance is used to compare the mean length while adjusting for width. An additional test is used to determine if species and width interact with each other. Lastly, a two way anova is done with the R data set names ToothGrowth where interaction plots between supp and dose are created.
